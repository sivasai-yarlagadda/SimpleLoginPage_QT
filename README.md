# SimpleLoginPage_QT

**Overview:**

This repository showcases a simple login page implementation using Qt framework, featuring static username and password authentication (`username: root`, `password: root`). It serves as a basic example for learning Qt GUI development and handling user authentication scenarios.

**Key Features:**

- **User Interface:** Designed a clean and intuitive login form with fields for username and password input.
- **Static Credentials:** Implemented authentication using default credentials (`username: root`, `password: root`) for simplicity.
- **Validation:** Validates user input and provides feedback on successful or unsuccessful login attempts.
- **Navigation:** Upon successful login, simulates navigation to a home page (or displays a message), while prompting for re-entry on failed attempts.

**How to Use:**

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open the project in Qt Creator or your preferred Qt development environment.
3. Build and run the application to see the login page in action.
4. Enter `root` as both the username and password to experience a successful login.

**Notes:**

- This project is intended as a starting point for understanding Qt GUI development.
- Customize the UI, add more features, or integrate with databases for real-world applications.

**Contributing:**

- Contributions and feedback are welcome! Feel free to fork the repository, make improvements, and submit pull requests.
